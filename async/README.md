## The Assignment
Part 1: Obtain the Project Files
To get started, download the reactive-async.zip handout archive file and extract it somewhere on your machine.

Part 2: Editing the Project
In case you like using an IDE, import the project into your IDE. If you are new to Scala and donâ€™t know which IDE to choose, we recommend to try IntelliJ. You can find information on how to import a Scala project into IntelliJ in the IntelliJ IDEA Tutorial page.

Then, in the folder src/main/scala, open the package async and double-click the file Async.scala. This files contains an object whose methods need to be implemented.

When working on an assignment, it is important that you don't change any existing method, class or object names or types. When doing so, our automated grading tools will not be able to recognize your code and you have a high risk of not obtaining any points for your solution.

Part 3: Running your Code
Once you start writing some code, you might want to experiment with Scala, execute small snippets of code, or also run some methods that you already implemented. We present two possibilities to run Scala code.

Note that these tools are recommended for exploring Scala, but should not be used for testing your code. The next section of this document will explain how to write tests in Scala.

Using the Scala REPL
In the sbt console, start the Scala REPL by typing console:

> console
[info] Starting scala interpreter...

scala>
In the REPL you can try out arbitrary snippets of Scala code, for example:

scala> val l = List(3,7,2)
l: List[Int] = List(3, 7, 2)

scala> l.isEmpty
res0: Boolean = false

scala> l.tail.head
res1: Int = 7

scala> List().isEmpty
res2: Boolean = true
The classes of the assignment are available inside the REPL, so you can for instance import all the methods from object Async:

scala> import async.Async._
import async.Async._

scala> transformSuccess(concurrent.Future.successful(3))
res1: scala.concurrent.Future[Boolean] = Future(Success(false))
In order to exit the Scala REPL and go back to sbt, just type ctrl-d.

Using a Main Object
Another way to run your code is to create a new Main object that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine.

In your code editor, create a new Main.scala file in the async package:

package async

object Main extends App {
  println(Async.transformSuccess(concurrent.Future.successful(3)))
}
In order to make the object executable it has to extend the type App.

You can run the Main object in the sbt console by simply using the command run.

Part 5: Testing your Code
Throughout the assignments of this course we will require you to write unit tests for the code that you write. Unit tests are the preferred way to test your code because unlike REPL commands, unit tests are saved and can be re-executed as often as required. This is a great way to make sure that nothing breaks when you have go back later to change some code that you wrote earlier on.

We will be using the ScalaTest testing framework to write our unit tests. Navigate to the folder src/test/scala and open the file AsyncSuite.scala in package async. This file contains a some tests for the methods that need to be implemented.

You can run the tests by invoking the test sbt command. A test report will be displayed, showing you which tests failed and which tests succeeded.

Part 6: Submitting your Solution
Once you implemented all the required methods and tested you code thoroughly, you can submit it to our graders. Use sbt to package your work into a single file and then upload it below.

You can run the packaging command from an sbt session:

> packageSubmission
Or from your OS shell:

$ sbt packageSubmission
If the command is successful you should see a submission.jar file in the project root directory.

Submit the submission.jar file to the below form. Once you submit your solution, you should see your grade and feedback about your code within 10 minutes.
